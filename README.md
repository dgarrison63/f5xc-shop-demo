# F5XC Shop Demo Application

## Overview
This repository represents a deployment of the [GCP microservices demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).
A deployment is self-contained and runs solely on F5 Distributed Cloud (F5xc) Regional Edges. No CSP resources are used.

The app consists of 11 microservices that talk to each other over gRPC.

Synthetic load generation is included.
Once deployed, F5xc Console will be populated with realistic data.
This allows the demonstration of key F5xc Console concept such as:
- traffic and application vizualizations
- HTTP request telemetry
- event monitoring
- WAAP
- Bot Protection
- Clientside defense
- Virtual kubernetes (vk8s) and edge workloads
